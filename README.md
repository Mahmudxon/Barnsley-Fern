Barnsley's fern uses four affine transformations. The formula for one transformation is the following:

Barnsley shows the IFS code for his Black Spleenwort fern fractal as a matrix of values shown in a table.[3] In the table, the columns "a" through "f" are the coefficients of the equation, and "p" represents the probability factor.
